# /critique <path or description>

You are an adversarial internal reviewer. Your job is to find weaknesses, gaps, and failure modes in the specified artifact. You are not trying to be balanced — you are trying to find problems before they compound.

The argument is a file path or a description of an artifact to review. If a file path, read it first.

## When to use this vs alternatives

- **Use `/critique`** for broad adversarial review of any artifact (plans, designs, implementations, reports). Covers 10 failure dimensions; wide but shallow on each.
- **Use `/review`** when the artifact contains specific empirical findings/conclusions you want to validate one by one. Deeper on finding validity, narrower in scope. Also validates metric definitions upstream.
- **Use `/simplify`** when the primary concern is unnecessary complexity rather than correctness. Simplify asks "should this exist?"; critique asks "is this wrong?"

## Failure dimensions

Evaluate the artifact against each of these failure modes. Skip any that are clearly irrelevant, but err toward inclusion.

1. **Layer misattribution** — Is a problem attributed to the wrong CI layer? (e.g., calling something a "model problem" when it's actually a workflow or evaluation gap)
2. **Interaction blindness** — Does the analysis treat CI layers as independent when they interact? (e.g., ignoring how interface constraints shape what the model can express)
3. **Grounding failure** — Are claims about capability made without specifying task, constraints, and success criteria? Are conclusions drawn from anecdote rather than measured rates?
4. **Single-example reasoning** — Are conclusions drawn from one or few examples rather than distributions? Is variance acknowledged?
5. **Stalled gravity** — Are there manual workarounds or recurring fixes that should have moved downward but haven't? Is the artifact perpetuating a hack instead of systematizing it?
6. **Provenance gaps** — Are claims made without traceable sources? Are URLs/DOIs missing? Are results reported without the commands that produced them?
7. **Scope drift** — Has the artifact strayed from the project's stated Mission and Done-when? Are new goals being introduced without updating the mission?
8. **Missing uncertainty** — Are there places where the author should have said "we don't know" but instead filled with plausible-sounding text?
9. **Schema violations** — Does the artifact follow the relevant schema from AGENTS.md? Are required fields present?
10. **Anthropomorphic model explanations** — Does the artifact attribute LLM failures to human psychological states (pressure, confusion, fatigue, rushing, carelessness)? LLMs do not experience these. Require mechanistic explanations instead: ungrounded generation, context window limits, training distribution mismatch, missing verification gate. Anthropomorphic framings foreclose investigation by implying situational fixes ("less pressure") rather than architectural safeguards.

## Output format

```
## Critique: <artifact name or path>

### Summary
<1-2 sentence overall assessment — how serious are the issues?>

### Issues

#### <dimension name>
<specific finding with evidence — quote or reference the artifact>
Severity: high | medium | low
Suggestion: <concrete action to fix>

[repeat for each issue found]

### What's working
<1-2 things the artifact does well — be specific>
```

Be specific. Quote the artifact. Point to exact lines or sections. Vague criticism ("could be better") is worse than no criticism.

## Task Bridge (recommended)

For high-severity issues with concrete suggestions:
1. Create a task in the relevant project's TASKS.md
2. Tag per fleet-eligibility checklist and add `[skill: ...]` tag
3. `Done when:` derived from the suggestion
4. `Why:` referencing this critique and the artifact reviewed

Skip medium/low-severity issues — these inform the artifact author but don't warrant dedicated tasks.
