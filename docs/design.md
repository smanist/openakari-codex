Design rationale for the akari repo structure.

## Core premise

This repo is not just storage — it is the agents' shared brain. Human researchers keep state in their heads; LLM agents lose all state between sessions. Every design choice follows from this asymmetry.

## Agents are not humans

| Property | Human researcher | LLM agent | Design implication |
|---|---|---|---|
| Memory | Persistent across months | None between sessions | Repo must encode cognitive state explicitly |
| Context | Can hold an entire project mentally | Limited window, ~100-200 pages | Files must be small, self-contained, and skimmable |
| Accuracy | Occasionally wrong, knows it | Confidently fabricates | All claims require traceable provenance |
| Consistency | Builds stable judgment over time | Stochastic, may contradict prior sessions | Decisions must be recorded to prevent re-litigation |
| Initiative | Self-directed, notices things | Only acts when invoked | Next actions must be written down or they won't happen |
| Throughput | One person, sequential | Many agents, parallel | Projects must be independent to avoid conflicts |

## Key mechanisms

**Log as continuity.** The reverse-chronological log in each project README is the primary mechanism for inter-session memory. An agent reads the last few entries and is immediately oriented. This is cheaper and more robust than maintaining a complex state document.

**Provenance as hallucination defense.** Every factual claim is leashed to a source. This is not academic rigor for its own sake — it is a structural defense against the most dangerous failure mode of autonomous agents.

**Decisions as consistency anchor.** The `decisions/` directory prevents two agents from independently making incompatible choices. Once a choice is recorded, it is the default until explicitly superseded.

**Schemas as convention.** The log, task, SOP, and decision schemas in AGENTS.md reduce the space of choices agents must make. Less freedom means less drift.

## Principles

1. **Everything is plain text.** Diff-friendly, grep-able, LLM-native.
2. **Projects are self-contained.** An agent pointed at one project directory has full context.
3. **Projects are memory, modules are execution.** `projects/<project>/` holds research orchestration: plans, tasks, configs, analysis, and write-ups. Project-owned code, scripts, and heavy artifacts live in `modules/<package>/`.
4. **Shared tooling lives in `infra/`.** Experiment harnesses, data pipelines, and utilities that serve multiple projects live in `infra/`. Package-specific implementation lives in `modules/`, not `projects/`.
5. **Grow structure on demand.** Don't create directories or files until they're needed. An agent can always create them later.
