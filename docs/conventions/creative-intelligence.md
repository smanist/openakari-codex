# Creative Intelligence (CI)

This file is the canonical location for the Creative Intelligence framework in this repo.

## What is Creative Intelligence?

**Creative Intelligence** is the capability of a *system* (humans + AI + tools) to:

- tackle open-ended creative tasks (design, art, animation, 3D, etc.),
- generate multiple plausible options,
- iterate and refine based on feedback,
- and develop a stable sense of “what is good” for a given context.

It is *not* just a powerful model. It emerges from:

- the model(s),
- the workflows and tools around them,
- the interfaces and languages users work through,
- the way we evaluate outputs,
- and how human makes decisions.

**CIS (Creative Intelligence System)** is the *full stack* of all of the above, designed explicitly to support creative work.

### The Creative Intelligence Layer Stack

We model a creative AI product as **five interacting layers**:

1. **Model (Layer 1)**
   - Foundation and task models (image, 3D, motion, etc.).
   - “Raw” generative capability and internal representations.

2. **Workflow (Layer 2)**
   - Pipelines, nodes, operators, scripts, services.
   - How models are chained, repaired, and connected to other tools.

3. **Interface (Layer 3)**
   - UI, prompts, node graphs, parameter panels, APIs.
   - How humans express intent, constrain behavior, and edit results.

4. **Evaluation (Layer 4)**
   - Metrics, test sets, QA, human review, task success rates.
   - How “good” and “bad” are made visible and comparable.
   - The **reality layer**: turns probabilistic behavior into observable performance.

5. **Human (Layer 5)**
   - How human decide what to build, what to fix, and how gravity flows.
   - How teams of humans produce structure, ownership, rituals, roadmaps.

Users never experience one layer in isolation.
They experience the *system* that results from all five.

### Three Fundamental Principles of Creative Intelligence

#### Principle 1 – Creative Intelligence is Distributed

- What users experience as “intelligence” comes from **all layers combined**:
  - model behavior,
  - workflows and repair steps,
  - interface and controls,
  - evaluation and filters,
  - human decisions.
- No single team, model, or component “owns” intelligence in practice.

**Consequences:**

- Many “model problems” are actually workflow, UX, or eval issues (and vice versa).
- Ownership must be defined per *capability* across layers, not just per function.
- Cross-functional work is not an optional add-on; it is the shape of the system.

#### Principle 2 – Creative Intelligence is Probabilistic

- For creative tasks, **there is no single deterministically “correct” output**.
- Even with very strong models, outputs will vary; some attempts will fail or be unusable.
- Success must be defined as:
  - **task-level success rates** (e.g., “usable asset rate”, “time to a good result”),
  - not “this one API call is always correct”.

**Consequences:**

- Creative intelligence systems must be **grounded by constraints** to learn about its capabilities.
- Product design must embrace **iteration, retries, and variation**, not “one magic button”.
- Reliability is about **the whole workflow**, not one perfect generation step.
- Evaluation must focus on **distributions and coverage**, not single examples.

#### Principle 3 – Creative Intelligence Has Downward Gravity

- Repeated manual fixes, scripts, and workflow hacks are **not stable end-states**.
- Over time, the system should absorb them as **deeper capabilities**:
  - manual fix → tool/operation → standard workflow → model behavior.
- Intelligence “flows downward” from:
  - human practice and workarounds,
  - into tools and pipelines,
  - and eventually into model training and data.

**Consequences:**

- Assume foundation model capabilities will improve and expand naturally; workflows today will be absorbed into future models.
- Every recurring pattern of human correction is a **signal** and a **roadmap item**.
- Roadmaps should explicitly plan how to log corrections, formalize them, and feed them into evaluation and training.
- If gravity is blocked (hacks never move down), complexity and cost explode.

---

### Secondary Conclusions

1. **Intelligence is unknown unless grounded with constraints.**
2. **Creative success is never guaranteed.**

---

### Practical Implications

- Design around workflows, not single shots.
- Make layers explicit in decisions.
- Use evaluation as the reality layer.
- Treat manual fixes as training signals.
